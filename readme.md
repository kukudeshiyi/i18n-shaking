   ```json
   {
     "entry": ["./src/index.tsx"],
     "output": "./output",
     "translateFileDirectoryPath": "./src/components/I18n",
     "translateFileNames": ["en.json", "vi.json", "th.json"],
     "importInfos": [
       { "name": "i18n", "path": "" },
       { "name": "", "path": "i18nDir" },
       { "name": "t", "path": "i18n-t" },
       { "name": "useTranslation", "path": "react-i18next" }
